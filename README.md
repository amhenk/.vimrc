# vimrc
Vimrc I use on pretty much every Linux based thing I can set it up on.

The setup script is pretty specific to Pathogen, so you've been warned.

List of repositories I'm using:
   * https://github.com/sonph/onehalf                       - Color Scheme
   * https://github.com/w0rp/ale                            - Syntax Checker
   * https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe              - Auto Complete
   * https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree                 - File Tree in Vim
   * https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter            - Code Commenting
